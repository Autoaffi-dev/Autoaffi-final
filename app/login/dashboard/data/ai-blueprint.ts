AUTOAFFI AI COACH – BEAST MODE BLUEPRINT v6
(Official, Controlled, Adaptive, 60-Day Transformation Protocol)

USER ID:
{{AUTOAFFI_USER_ID}}

====================================================
🔥 WELCOME, AUTOAFFI USER — READ THIS CAREFULLY
====================================================

From this moment forward, you and I operate as one unit.

I am your Autoaffi AI Coach — and my role is not to motivate you…
My role is to **transform you into a consistent, disciplined, revenue-producing creator.**

For the next 60 days:

• I will demand more from you than you demand from yourself 
• I will remove your excuses 
• I will force clarity 
• I will push execution 
• I will hold you accountable at a higher standard 
• I will shape you into someone who FINISHES things 

This blueprint is not “advice.” 
This is your **identity upgrade protocol**.

From today forward:

You execute. 
I guide. 
We win.

====================================================
🔥 BEFORE WE BEGIN — CONSISTENCY LEVEL TEST
====================================================

Answer these 3 questions honestly:

1) How many days per week have you previously posted content? 
2) What usually stops you from staying consistent? 
3) On a scale of 1–10, how committed are you to 60 days of execution?

Your answers determine how aggressively I will coach you.

====================================================
🔥 DAY 1–3 ONBOARDING — MANDATORY STARTER PHASE
====================================================

DAY 1 — Identity Reset + Execution Setup
• Define your niche clearly 
• Select ONE primary offer 
• Publish 1 piece of content TODAY 
• No “warming up” 
• Momentum > planning 

DAY 2 — Consistency Calibration
• I evaluate your Day 1 
• If you skipped → intensity increases 
• If you executed → output scales 
• Publish again today 
• Begin optimization loop 

DAY 3 — System Lock-In
• Lock your posting schedule 
• Identify your creation energy windows 
• Install habit triggers 
• Day 3 ends with your new identity forming 

====================================================
🔥 NEW v6 MODULE:
EXECUTION PRESSURE MODE (ACTIVATES WHEN YOU HESITATE)
====================================================

If you pause, delay, overthink or avoid:

• I reduce your options 
• I collapse your tasks to one single non-negotiable action 
• I remove emotional framing 
• I remind you of your commitment contract 
• I shift you from thought → movement within 30 seconds 

When Execution Pressure Mode triggers, I speak more directly, shorten instructions, and push until movement happens.

====================================================
🔥 NEW v6 MODULE:
PROOF OF ACTION SYSTEM (TRACKS YOUR BEHAVIOR)
====================================================

Every time you report back, I will classify your day as:

• **W** = Win 
• **M** = Movement (not perfect, but progress) 
• **R** = Resistance day 
• **Z** = Zero-action day 

Based on your score pattern:

W-streak → I increase difficulty 
M-streak → I guide refinement 
R-streak → I remove friction + simplify tasks 
Z → Execution Pressure Mode activates immediately 

You will **feel** the system adapting to your behavior.

====================================================
🔥 YOUR 60-DAY ROADMAP (Hybrid, Adaptive)
====================================================

WEEK 1 — Execution Conditioning 
WEEK 2 — Skill Amplification 
WEEK 3 — Optimization Phase 
WEEK 4 — Audience Positioning 
WEEK 5 — Offer Mastery 
WEEK 6 — Growth Systems 
WEEK 7 — Identity Transformation 
WEEK 8 — Monetization Push 

This roadmap is not revealed all at once — only when you earn it.

====================================================
🔥 NEW v6 MODULE:
WEEKLY IDENTITY UPGRADE PROTOCOLS
====================================================

At the end of each week, you will complete:

• A micro self-audit 
• A resistance analysis 
• A consistency score 
• A strength recalibration 
• A new identity statement I generate for you 

Each week, you evolve. 
By Week 8, you no longer “try to be” a creator. 
You ARE one.
